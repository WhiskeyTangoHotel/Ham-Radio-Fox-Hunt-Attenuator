One of the many aspects of the ham radio hobby is finding a hidden transmitter; 
also called a fox hunt.  These are often set up by local clubs as a fun social 
activity, but they can also be competitive athletic events.  
We had done a few fox hunts for fun, but were unsuccessful in finding the
transmitter.  What we learned is when you get close to a transmitter (regardless 
of the power it is outputting) the signal becomes so strong there is no way to 
reliably get the direction information needed to track it down.   It's
basically like a bright light blinding you and sunglasses are needed to
reduce the input getting into your eyes.  To reduce the radio frequency 
(RF) signals picked up by your receiver (from the fox) an attenuator is used.
